                        <p>Horology is the art and science of watch making. It is an extremely complex, yet facinating art.<p>
                        <p>The heart of any watch is the movement. There are a few different types of watch movements in analog watches. The cheapest and simplest form is the quartz movement. In these movements, a small electrical charge is sent through a quartz crystal which causes it to ocilate at a certain frequency, which is used to keep time. These became very popular because of their simplicity and the fact that they are expremely accurate. The other two forms are the hand-wound mechanical and the automatic. These movement are essentially the same besides one crucial part the will be discussed later.  In the simplest explanation, a mechanical watch movement is a gear train ( a series of gears, known as wheels, that run off of each other) that turns the watch hands (usually the second hand.). The tricky part is getting all of these wheels to work together to create a steady beat. </p>
                        <p>It all starts with the barrel. The barrel is were the power of the watch is stored. Inside the barrel is the mainspring. The mainspring is a tightly coiled piece of metal when undone, turns the barrel. The barrel has teeth that then power the rest of the gear train. </p>
                        <p>The barrel can only rotate so many times, so that is why the gear train is important. The purpose of the other wheels in the gear train is to change the gear ratio in order to turn the minute hand more times. Without this, a watch would have to be rewound every few menutes. With a carefully calculated number of wheels, each with a carefully calculated number of teeth, the number of rotations can go from five or six to thousands. In fact, some watch get close to 100,000 rotations, or a 65 day power reserve (how long the watch can last between being wound).</P>
                        <p>There will be more, but for now that is all I will explain. This is do to the fact that I am still learning.</p>
